**⚠CODE IN THIS REPO IS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN. RESEARCH IS STILL IN PROGRESS⚠**

This repository is a sample SPA web page to design *wajan bolik* satellite dish,
a DIY Wi-Fi signal strength amplifier using household things.

## 🧐 What you'll find in this repo

A simple and straight forward SPA page where you can enter different variables
and execute simulations. All processes is done in client-side, which means
this code runs fast.

- SPA to enter different satellite dish variables.
- Transmission power simulation to calculate maximum and optimum distance between
  the receiver and transmitter.
- Outputs detailed information about the proposed satellite dish design.

## 🏗 The architecture

This app uses basic SPA using Vue.js, nothing fancy😄

## 👻 What I've used in this repo

- VueJS
- ChartJS
- Bulma CSS
- FontAwesome 5

## 🏃‍ Running locally

You can use [Live Server](1) for Visual Studio Code or use any kind of local web server.
For example if you want to run this using `http-server`, you can do:

```
npm install http-server -g
http-server . -p 8000
```
